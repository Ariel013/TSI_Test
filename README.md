# TSI Application - Basketball Player Statistics

This project uses React.js for the frontend and Express.js for the backend.
It's made to see BasketBall players statistics

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run the following commands:
### FRONTEND

### `npm start`

### BACKEND

### `npm run dev`

Runs the application in development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will automatically reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

### `npm run build`

Builds the application for production in the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.


**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point, you're on your own.

## Project Structure

- `frontend/`: Contains the code for the React.js frontend.
- `backend/`: Contains the code for the Express.js backend.

Make sure to check the `frontend/` and `backend/` subdirectories for specific instructions for each part of the project.

Don't forget to look at the .env file to see how to set your environnements variables.
